**Week/Day:** W1-D1  
**Topic:** Oracle Architecture

## 1. Introduction  
- **Purpose:** Overview of Oracle Architecture and its significance.  
- **Learning Goals:** What you intend to understand and achieve with this study session.  
- **Context:** Brief note on your current level of knowledge and any prerequisites.  
- **Tools/Environment:** List any lab environments or tools you'll be using.

## 2. Overview of Oracle Architecture  
- **Definition and Scope:** Brief description of what Oracle Architecture encompasses.  
- **Key Components:**  
  - **Instance:** Memory structures and background processes.  
  - **Database:** Datafiles, redo logs, control files.  
  - **Memory Structures:** System Global Area (SGA) and Program Global Area (PGA).  
  - **Background Processes:** DBWR, LGWR, SMON, PMON, etc.  
  - **Physical Storage:** How datafiles, redo logs, and control files interact.

## 3. Top 5 Questions  
1. **Can you explain the overall Oracle database architecture?**  
   - Instance vs. Database  
   - Memory Structures (SGA, PGA)  
   - Process Components  
   - Interplay between instance and database  
2. **What are the key components of the System Global Area (SGA) and their roles?**  
   - Shared Pool, Database Buffer Cache, Redo Log Buffer, and others  
3. **What are the main Oracle background processes and what functions do they serve?**  
   - DBWR, LGWR, SMON, PMON, and additional processes  
4. **How does Oracle handle memory management, particularly with the interaction between the SGA and the Program Global Area (PGA)?**  
   - Roles of SGA and PGA  
   - Dynamic memory management  
   - Performance implications  
5. **Can you describe Oracle’s physical storage architecture, including the roles of datafiles, redo logs, and control files?**  
   - Datafiles, redo logs, control files  
   - Data integrity & recovery mechanisms
