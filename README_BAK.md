## How to Use This Repository
- **Theoretical Content:** Check the `/docs` folder for your ultimate goal, job requirements analysis, and your focused study plan.
- **Practical Exercises:** Head to the `/labs` folder to find hands-on exercises, code samples, and lab projects.
- **Notes & Reflections:** Use the `/notes` folder to review daily and weekly insights, challenges, and progress.
- **External Resources:** Visit the `/bookmarks` folder for curated articles, tutorials, and references that support your study areas.

## Interview Preparation Plan
In addition to the study plan, I've outlined a detailed interview preparation strategy to ensure readiness on both technical and behavioral fronts:

- **Daily & Weekly Reviews:** Regularly revisit notes and lab work to reinforce learning.
- **Mock Interview Sessions:** 
  - Schedule bi-weekly mock interviews (both solo and with peers/mentors).
  - Practice technical questions (e.g., Oracle tools, performance tuning, Azure integration) and behavioral scenarios using the STAR method.
- **Hands-On Practice:** 
  - Continuously work through lab exercises to simulate real-world scenarios.
  - Document troubleshooting and performance tuning experiences.
- **Feedback Loop:** 
  - Collect feedback after each mock interview.
  - Update and refine notes in the `/notes/soft_skills` folder based on feedback.
- **Final Preparation:** 
  - In the last days before the interview, perform a holistic review of all documentation.
  - Conduct a comprehensive mock interview to build confidence and polish responses.
