### Top 5 Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is the Oracle Multitenant Architecture, and how do CDBs differ from PDBs?
- **Oracle Multitenant Architecture Overview:**  
   Introduced in Oracle 12c, the multitenant architecture allows multiple databases (pluggable databases) to share a single "container" (container database). It simplifies consolidation, patching, and resource management by letting you "plug" or "unplug" databases without disrupting others.

- **CDB (Container Database):**  
   - **Definition:**  
     The primary container that holds Oracle metadata and manages overall system resources.
   - **Components:**  
     - Includes the root (common) container, which stores common objects and data dictionary metadata.
     - Contains a seed PDB for creating new pluggable databases.
   - **Management:**  
     Manages system-wide operations such as instance startup, memory allocation, and background processes.

- **PDB (Pluggable Database):**  
   - **Definition:**  
     A self-contained, portable database that shares the CDB’s underlying instance and infrastructure.
   - **Characteristics:**  
     - Has its own data files, schemas, and metadata.
     - Relies on the CDB for common components (e.g., background processes, memory).
   - **Flexibility:**  
     Can be easily moved (plugged/unplugged) to or from different CDBs, facilitating easier deployment and consolidation.
